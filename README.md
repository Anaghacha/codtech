- PIR Motion Sensor
- LED
- 220Î© Resistor
- Buzzer
- Jumper Wires

## Circuit Diagram
1. **PIR Sensor**  
   - **VCC** â†’ **5V** on Arduino  
   - **GND** â†’ **GND** on Arduino  
   - **OUT** â†’ **Pin 8** on Arduino  

2. **LED**  
   - **Anode (long leg)** â†’ **Pin 9** via a **220Î© resistor**  
   - **Cathode (short leg)** â†’ **GND**  

3. **Buzzer**  
   - **Positive (+)** â†’ **Pin 10**  
   - **Negative (-)** â†’ **GND**  

## Installation & Usage
1. **Upload the Code**  
   - Open the Arduino IDE.  
   - Copy and paste the code below into the **Arduino IDE**.  
   - Select the correct **Board** and **Port**.  
   - Click **Upload**.  

2. **Open Serial Monitor**  
   - Set the baud rate to **9600**.  
   - When motion is detected, the LED will turn on, and the buzzer will sound.  
   - The Serial Monitor will display **"Motion detected!"**.  
   - When motion stops, the Serial Monitor will display **"Motion stopped!"**.  



#  TASK 4 :IoT Air Quality Monitor ðŸš€

This repository contains the **IoT Air Quality Monitoring System** using **Arduino, ESP8266, and an LCD display** to measure and transmit air quality data.

---

## **Project Overview**
This project monitors **air quality** using an **analog sensor** and displays the data on an **LCD screen** while sending it to the cloud using **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module**.

### **Key Features**
âœ… **Air Quality Monitoring** â€“ Reads sensor values and determines air quality levels.  
âœ… **LCD Display** â€“ Shows real-time air quality in **PPM (Parts Per Million)**.  
âœ… **Cloud Integration** â€“ Sends data to **ThingSpeak** for remote monitoring.  
âœ… **Wi-Fi Connectivity** â€“ Uses **ESP8266** for seamless cloud updates.  
âœ… **Smart Alerts** â€“ Displays **Fresh Air, Poor Air, or Very Poor** based on air quality levels.
